## Goal
Complete ship blockers: About window, Sparkle updates, folder reorganization

## Progress
- Added `NSHumanReadableCopyright` to `Config/Shared.xcconfig` for About panel
- Verified About window shows app icon, version "1.0 (1)", copyright "© 2025 Luce & Sumbrarum"
- Confirmed Sparkle integration already complete (Check for Updates menu enabled)
- Enabled Hardened Runtime for notarization (`ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES`)
- **Archived and notarized successfully** - "Ready to distribute"
- Cleaned up docs folder (removed duplicates, added missing template files)
- **Reorganized project with numbered folders:**
  - `01_Project/` - Xcode project, source, config
  - `02_Design/` - Icon source files and exports
  - `03_Screenshots/` - App Store (empty)
  - `04_Exports/` - Built DMGs (gitignored)
- Added keyboard shortcuts: ⌘O (Open), ⌘E (Export)
- **Fixed ⌘E crash:** Swift 6 strict concurrency issue - notification handlers weren't @MainActor-safe
  - Wrapped `.onReceive` handlers in `Task { @MainActor in }`
  - Removed duplicate `Notification.Name` definitions from main app (use public ones from feature module)

## Decisions
- Use standard macOS About panel (auto-pulls from Info.plist) rather than custom view
- Copyright format: "© 2025 Luce & Sumbrarum. All rights reserved."
- NotificationCenter for menu-to-view communication (decoupled)
- Notification handlers must use `Task { @MainActor in }` for @MainActor-isolated calls (Swift 6)

## Next
- Ship!
