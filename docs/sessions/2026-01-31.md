## Goal
Complete ship blockers: About window and Sparkle updates

## Progress
- Added `NSHumanReadableCopyright` to `Config/Shared.xcconfig` for About panel
- Verified About window shows app icon, version "1.0 (1)", copyright "© 2025 Luce & Sumbrarum"
- Confirmed Sparkle integration already complete (Check for Updates menu enabled)
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude DS_Store, fastembed cache, review artifacts
- Added shared Xcode scheme and Package.resolved for CI/reproducibility
- Force pushed all changes to GitHub (local was source of truth)

## Decisions
- Use standard macOS About panel (auto-pulls from Info.plist) rather than custom view
- Copyright format: "© 2025 Luce & Sumbrarum. All rights reserved."

## Next
- Ship blockers complete - ready to ship
- Optional polish: Reveal in Finder, export notifications
- Consider notarization for distribution
