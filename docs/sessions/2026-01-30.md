# Session: 2026-01-30

## Goal
Verify and refine the fixing plan using semantic code analysis (MCP tools)

## Context
- Previous session: [2026-01-29](2026-01-29.md) - Added Sparkle auto-updates, received code reviews
- Current phase: Pre-release bug fixing
- Input: `fixing-plan-2026-01-29.md` created from 3 independent code reviews

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Read fixing plan from code reviews (Gemini Pro, Claude Opus, Codex)
- [x] Activated Serena MCP for semantic code analysis
- [x] Verified Wave 1.1 (AVPlayer observer leak) - CONFIRMED
- [x] Verified Wave 2.1 (Export settings) - PARTIALLY CORRECT (resolution works for HEVC)
- [x] Verified Wave 2.2 (Match Original misleading) - CONFIRMED
- [x] Verified Wave 2.3 (Trim validation) - CONFIRMED
- [x] Verified Wave 3.2 (Drop handlers) - CONFIRMED with exact UTType differences
- [x] Identified Wave 5.1 as FALSE POSITIVE (MainActor wrapper is required)
- [x] Updated fixing plan with verification status, corrected line numbers, missing fixes

### Discovered
- Original plan missed `removeEndObserver()` in the cleanup fix
- Resolution settings DO work for HEVC quality (uses preset variants)
- Resolution settings DON'T work for ProRes (always same preset)
- Frame rate settings never work (no AVMutableVideoComposition)
- `Task { @MainActor }` wrapper in time observer is CORRECT for Swift concurrency (main queue ≠ MainActor isolation)

### Decisions Made
- Keep fixing plan in session folder (not a formal decision doc)
- Wave 5.1 removed from plan - not a bug

---

## Session 2 - Implementation

### Goal
Execute Wave 1 and Wave 2 fixes from verified fixing plan

### Progress

#### Wave 1 (Critical) ✅
- [x] Added `cleanupCurrentPlayer()` method to AppState
- [x] Removes all 3 observer types: time, end, outPoint
- [x] Called before creating new player in `loadVideo()`
- [x] Committed: `5192ab4`

#### Wave 2 (High Priority) ✅
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Hidden frame rate picker (not functional), added resolution caveat
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Removed "Match Original" option entirely (was misleading - transcoded to HEVC)
- [x] **Task 2.3**: Added trim validation - prevents out ≤ in, duration < 0.1s
- [x] Committed: `d61721e`, `6f8249d`

### Commits
```
5192ab4 fix(wave-1): AVPlayer observer lifecycle leak
d61721e fix(wave-2): remove misleading export options
6f8249d fix(wave-2): add trim time range validation
```

### Decisions
- Removed `matchOriginal` enum case entirely (cleaner than renaming)
- Frame rate picker commented out with TODO for v1.1 (honest about limitations)
- Minimum trim duration set to 0.1s (prevents edge cases in encoding)

---

## Session 3 - Architecture Refactoring (Wave 3)

### Goal
Execute Wave 3 from fixing plan - architecture improvements

### Progress

#### Wave 1 (Foundational Types) ✅
- [x] `QuickMotionError.swift` - Typed errors with LocalizedError conformance
- [x] `VideoDropHandler.swift` - Unified UTType handling for drops
- [x] `VideoPlayerService.swift` - Protocol for player abstraction
- [x] Committed: `f167f6a`

#### Wave 2 (Implementation) ✅
- [x] `AVPlayerService.swift` - AVPlayer implementation of protocol
- [x] Integrated VideoDropHandler in ContentView + DropZoneView
- [x] Fixed Swift 6 concurrency issues with Task { @MainActor } wrappers
- [x] Committed: `eb359c6`

#### Wave 3 (Integration) ✅
- [x] Refactored AppState to use AVPlayerService (delegates player ops)
- [x] AppState conforms to VideoPlayerServiceDelegate for callbacks
- [x] Removed observer management code from AppState
- [x] Updated ExportSession to use QuickMotionError for validation
- [x] Committed: `6d913b7`

### Commits
```
f167f6a feat(wave-1): add foundational types for architecture refactor
eb359c6 feat(wave-2): implement AVPlayerService, integrate VideoDropHandler
6d913b7 feat(wave-3): integrate VideoPlayerService into AppState
b4140e3 docs: update PROJECT_STATE after Wave 3 architecture refactor
```

### Metrics
- AppState: 447 → 338 lines (24% reduction)
- New files: 4 (error, handler, protocol, service)
- Modified files: 4 (AppState, ExportSession, ContentView, DropZoneView)

### Decisions
- AVPlayerService exposes `player: AVPlayer?` for AVPlayerView binding
- Removed deinit from AVPlayerService (Swift 6 MainActor restrictions) - callers use `cleanup()`
- Kept ExportError for internal setup errors, QuickMotionError for user-facing errors

---

## Session 4 - Sparkle Fix + Export Performance

### Goal
Fix Sparkle framework crash, investigate slow export performance

### Progress

#### Sparkle Framework Fix ✅
- [x] App crashed on launch: `Library not loaded: @rpath/Sparkle.framework`
- [x] **Root cause**: SPM binary framework not embedded + missing rpath
- [x] **Fix 1**: Added `CodeSignOnCopy` attribute to Sparkle build file in project.pbxproj
- [x] **Fix 2**: Added `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS = @executable_path/../Frameworks` to Shared.xcconfig
- [x] App now launches successfully with Sparkle embedded

#### Export Performance Investigation
- [x] User tested 93-minute 6K video at 10x speed
- [x] Export estimated ~47 minutes with only 12% CPU usage
- [x] **Root cause**: `AVAssetExportSession` with `scaleTimeRange()` processes ALL frames
- [x] Even at 10x speed, all 93 minutes of frames are decoded and re-encoded
- [x] Created frame decimation plan (`frame-decimation-plan.md` in Serena memory)

### Decisions
- **Sparkle embedding**: Two-part fix required for SPM binary frameworks:
  1. Embed framework (CodeSignOnCopy)
  2. Add rpath so dyld can find it
- **Export performance**: Plan to implement frame decimation using AVAssetReader/AVAssetWriter
  - Keep every Nth frame (N = speed multiplier)
  - Expected ~10x speedup for 10x timelapse

### Frame Decimation Plan (Pending Approval)
```
Current:  AVAssetExportSession → scaleTimeRange (all frames, slow)
Proposed: AVAssetReader → Decimator → AVAssetWriter (1/N frames, fast)
```

| Metric | Current | With Decimation |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 93min 6K @ 10x | ~47 min | ~5-8 min |

---

## Session 5 - Frame Decimation Implementation

### Goal
Implement frame decimation export for ~10x faster timelapse exports

### Progress

#### Wave 1 (Foundational) ✅
- [x] Created `FrameDecimationExporter.swift` service
  - AVAssetReader → frame decimation → AVAssetWriter pipeline
  - Keeps every Nth frame (N = floor(speedMultiplier))
  - Remaps timestamps for correct output timing
  - Supports HEVC and ProRes based on ExportSettings.quality
  - Progress callback with MainActor isolation for UI updates
- [x] Added `shouldUseFrameDecimation(speedMultiplier:)` to ExportSettings
  - Returns true for speed > 2x (threshold where decimation is beneficial)

#### Wave 2 (Integration) ✅
- [x] Integrated FrameDecimationExporter into ExportSession
  - Routes to frame decimation for speed > 2x
  - Falls back to AVAssetExportSession for speed ≤ 2x
  - Updated cancel() to handle both export paths

#### Wave 3 (Verification) ✅
- [x] Build succeeded with all tests passing

### Commits
```
45f5a64 feat: implement frame decimation export for ~10x faster timelapse exports
```

### Key Files
- `Services/FrameDecimationExporter.swift` - New AVAssetReader/Writer pipeline
- `Models/ExportSettings.swift` - Added `shouldUseFrameDecimation()` method
- `ViewModels/ExportSession.swift` - Routing logic + integration

### Technical Details
- Frame interval: `max(1, Int(speedMultiplier.rounded()))`
- Output framerate: min(sourceFrameRate, 30fps) for typical timelapse
- Pixel format: `kCVPixelFormatType_420YpCbCr8BiPlanarVideoRange`
- Swift 6 compliant with `@MainActor @Sendable` progress callback

## Next
- [ ] Test with 6K source video to verify performance improvement
- [ ] Consider adding UI indicator showing "Fast Export" mode

## Notes
- SPM binary frameworks (like Sparkle) need manual rpath configuration
- AVAssetExportSession is convenient but offers no frame-level control
- Frame decimation trades smooth interpolation for speed (preferred for timelapse)
