# Session: 2026-01-30

## Goal
Verify and refine the fixing plan using semantic code analysis (MCP tools)

## Context
- Previous session: [2026-01-29](2026-01-29.md) - Added Sparkle auto-updates, received code reviews
- Current phase: Pre-release bug fixing
- Input: `fixing-plan-2026-01-29.md` created from 3 independent code reviews

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Read fixing plan from code reviews (Gemini Pro, Claude Opus, Codex)
- [x] Activated Serena MCP for semantic code analysis
- [x] Verified Wave 1.1 (AVPlayer observer leak) - CONFIRMED
- [x] Verified Wave 2.1 (Export settings) - PARTIALLY CORRECT (resolution works for HEVC)
- [x] Verified Wave 2.2 (Match Original misleading) - CONFIRMED
- [x] Verified Wave 2.3 (Trim validation) - CONFIRMED
- [x] Verified Wave 3.2 (Drop handlers) - CONFIRMED with exact UTType differences
- [x] Identified Wave 5.1 as FALSE POSITIVE (MainActor wrapper is required)
- [x] Updated fixing plan with verification status, corrected line numbers, missing fixes

### Discovered
- Original plan missed `removeEndObserver()` in the cleanup fix
- Resolution settings DO work for HEVC quality (uses preset variants)
- Resolution settings DON'T work for ProRes (always same preset)
- Frame rate settings never work (no AVMutableVideoComposition)
- `Task { @MainActor }` wrapper in time observer is CORRECT for Swift concurrency (main queue ≠ MainActor isolation)

### Decisions Made
- Keep fixing plan in session folder (not a formal decision doc)
- Wave 5.1 removed from plan - not a bug

---

## Session 2 - Implementation

### Goal
Execute Wave 1 and Wave 2 fixes from verified fixing plan

### Progress

#### Wave 1 (Critical) ✅
- [x] Added `cleanupCurrentPlayer()` method to AppState
- [x] Removes all 3 observer types: time, end, outPoint
- [x] Called before creating new player in `loadVideo()`
- [x] Committed: `5192ab4`

#### Wave 2 (High Priority) ✅
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Hidden frame rate picker (not functional), added resolution caveat
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Removed "Match Original" option entirely (was misleading - transcoded to HEVC)
- [x] **Task 2.3**: Added trim validation - prevents out ≤ in, duration < 0.1s
- [x] Committed: `d61721e`, `6f8249d`

### Commits
```
5192ab4 fix(wave-1): AVPlayer observer lifecycle leak
d61721e fix(wave-2): remove misleading export options
6f8249d fix(wave-2): add trim time range validation
```

### Decisions
- Removed `matchOriginal` enum case entirely (cleaner than renaming)
- Frame rate picker commented out with TODO for v1.1 (honest about limitations)
- Minimum trim duration set to 0.1s (prevents edge cases in encoding)

## Next Session
- Wave 3: Architecture refactoring (VideoPlayerService extraction)
- Wave 4: Add unit tests for speed mapping, export settings
- Manual testing: rapid video switching, export edge cases

## Notes
- Used /execute skill with parallel developer agents for Wave 2
- Build verified after each wave - all changes compile cleanly
- v1.0 critical/high bugs now fixed
