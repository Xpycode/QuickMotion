## Issues Found

| Severity | Item | Location | Note |
|----------|------|----------|------|
| **Low** | Force unwraps | `AppState.swift:281, 306` | Safe (hardcoded non-empty array) but technically flagged |
| **Low** | `try?` usage | `ExportSession.swift` | 4 instances - all justified (cleanup/fallback) |
| **Low** | File over 500 lines | `ExportSession.swift` | 522 lines - slightly over guideline |
| **Low** | No CHANGELOG | Root | Missing changelog file |
| **Low** | No logging framework | Codebase-wide | Errors shown but not logged |

---

## Summary

**22 of 27 items passed. 5 low-severity items noted.**

**Verdict: Ready to ship** - The issues are all low severity and don't block release:
- Force unwraps are safe (hardcoded arrays)
- `try?` usage is justified for cleanup/fallback
- 522 vs 500 line limit is minor
- CHANGELOG and logging are nice-to-haves
