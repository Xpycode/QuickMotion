# Session: 2026-01-23

## Goal
Implement missing `/execute` command that was advertised but not wired up.

## Progress
- Discovered `/execute` was documented in `commands/execute.md` but never registered as a skill
- Created `~/.claude/commands/execute.md` (the actual command file)
- Streamlined from 131 → 77 lines (removed example transcript, kept actionable instructions)
- Synced to Directions repo
- Committed and pushed to GitHub (`29dda34`)

## Decisions
- Commands should be concise and actionable, not documentation-heavy
- The command file IS the instruction - no need for separate docs vs command versions

## Also This Session
- Captured FeedbackKit idea → `ideas.md`
  - Swift Package for in-app bug reports / feedback
  - macOS first, iOS later
  - Pluggable delivery (mail, webhook, self-hosted)
  - Can leverage Mac minis or Strato for backend

## Next
- Test `/execute` in a real project
- Consider adding more missing commands if any
- Consider starting FeedbackKit as separate Swift Package project
